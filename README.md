# Verifiable delay function implementations
I implement the VDF protocols from Wesolowski [1] and Pietrzak [2] in C/C++, using both OpenSSL and GNU MP for handling large integers.
I employ OpenSSL for its cryptographic features and GNU MP for its more user-friendly RNG.

The random oracle that hashes into a large set of prime numbers -- needed in the Wesolowski protocol -- is implemented using acceptance-rejection sampling.

## Mac Need to brew install openssl@1.1
```
For compilers to find openssl@1.1 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/include"

For pkg-config to find openssl@1.1 you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/pkgconfig"
```
